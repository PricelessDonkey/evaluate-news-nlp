# Project Instructions

The purpose of this project was to utilize webpack in order to leverage the Alyien CDK, load sass files, and build an express app.

## Information

The main requirements were:
1. create an express app
2. use webpack to have separate production and development builds
3. use Jest to add unit tests for relevant JS files
4. use service workers to cache the page

I also added some styling to make the page more visually appealing.
